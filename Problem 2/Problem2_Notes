NOTES
fib sequence is next number(N) is the sum of the two previous numbers (a + b).
N = a + b shown as 0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5,  etc.

a + b = N ..
first number(a) = Fibonacci sequence number minus 1... 
second number(b) = Fibonacci sequence number minus 2..
sum(N) = sum of the first and second number.

If you initialize an array..
